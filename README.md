# Fantasy Sliding
This app is a fantasy sports prediction app for bobsled and skeleton, launching in October 2014. You make your predictions for the Top 10 finishers
for any circuit you want (World Cup, Interncontinental Cup, America's Cup, Europa Cup, or even National races). You get 3 points for a
correct guess, 2 points for a guess one spot away, and 1 point for a guess two spots away. You can create your own public and private leagues and invite
friends to play.
